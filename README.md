# Trying to replace Wordpress with Static Site Generators? 

Me too. But when you arrive with a solution based on a Static Site Generator (Hugo, Gatsby) and a HeadlessCMS like NetlifyCMS, maybe users are not comfortable because they know how to edit on Wordpress.

Then, an alternative is to use WP as a HeadlessCMS and use a SSG to render frontend (Gatsby has a great plugin to get content from WP REST API).

This is a proof of concept to try post, pages, categories and pagination.
